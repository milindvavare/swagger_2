          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible. Some Master Perfumers recommend going to work in raw material factories in Grasse. This allows you to be in direct contact",

Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are.

He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you.

Duchaufour's style of light/dark note combination, especially in his fragrances based on incense has received substantial critical praise. In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now. Nonetheless, Timbuktu from L'Artisan Parfumeur is seriously one of the best fragrances I have smelled in my life, and he has made plenty more on the same level.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Is it his perfect balance of notes and accords, or is it maybe his attention to detail like no other perfumer has?\"\n\"Maybe, but the real reason why I have placed his as the best nose of all time is that besides the perfume industry and fragrance enthusiasts, many might not know him by his name, but be sure that millions wear his perfume creations.\"\n\"\"\n\"The man knows his work without getting into mass-pleasing territory like Alberto Morillas does which by the way is not bad as well.\"\n\"Even if anyone disagrees with places some took, I highly doubt anyone could disagree that Dominique is the best nose of all time.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible. Some Master Perfumers recommend going to work in raw material factories in Grasse. This allows you to be in direct contact",

Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Hugo Boss Boss Bottled\"\n\"2. Boucheron Jaipur Homme\"\n\"3. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Dior Hypnotic Poison\"\n\"9. Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are. Even if he never made another perfume ever again, Pierre has left an indelible mark on the perfume industry and perfume lovers all around the world.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Michel Almairac\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Perfumer Michel Almairac was born in Grasse, France in 1953. He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you. One of the best. Thank you, Michel.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Joop! Homme Joop!\"\n\"\"\n\"3. Gucci pour Homme 1\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Christian Dior Fahrenheit\"\n\"7.

Alberto is the creator of numerous best-selling men's and women's perfumes that shaped the fragrance industry into what it is today.\"\n\"In 1997, along with his wife, Morillas founded a niche perfume brand Mizensir that offers a line of scented candles and perfumes.\"\n\"Why is Alberto Morillas one of the best perfumers in the world: Depending on the way you look at it, Alberto could be your favorite or worst perfumer in the world.\"\n\"Since I'm always on the objective side of the specter of perfumery, I cannot ignore how much did master perfumer brought to our dear hobby, and how he transcendent from someone being a self-taught chemist to the most popular and adorable perfumer amongst common folk and perfume enthusiasts.\"\n\"I highly doubt that",

Duchaufour's style of light/dark note combination, especially in his fragrances based on incense has received substantial critical praise. In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now. Nonetheless, Timbuktu from L'Artisan Parfumeur is seriously one of the best fragrances I have smelled in my life, and he has made plenty more on the same level.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Francis Kurkdjian\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Francis Kurkdjian is a French perfumer and owner of Maison Francis Kurkdjian Paris which he founded with his business partner Marc Chaya in 2009.\"\n\"Besides owning its own perfume brand, Francis Kurkdjian is also known for creating the Le Male for Jean Paul Gaultier in 1995 which became one of the world's best-selling perfumes and has cooperated with more than 45 different fragrance brands so far.\"\n\"\"\n\"Francis Kurkdjian is the current in-house perfumer at Christian Dior.\"\n\"Why is Francis Kurkdjian one of the best perfumers in the world: Best known for the creation of Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male which has become one of the world's best-selling perfumes, and was his first-ever created perfume, Francis owns the currently most popular niche fragrance brand in the world.\"\n\"It could be also argued that he is almost solely responsible for making niche perfumery a common topic and an essential beauty product with much wider audiences. Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male\"\n\"2. Elizabeth Arden Green Tea\"\n\"3. Narciso Rodriguez for Him\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau De Parfum\"\n\"4. Jean-Claude Ellena\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Jean-Claude Ellena is a french perfumer and writer who was born into a family of perfumers in Grasse, France, and from early age picked jasmine with his grandmother to sell to perfumers.\"\n\"A long-time friend of legendary Edmond Roudnitska he began his student and later on, a professional career at an early age in the newly formed Givaudan in 1968.\"\n\"There, Ellena developed his minimalistic approach to perfumery kept until this day of softness, nothing shocking, and a gentlemanly approach.\"\n\"\"\n\"Why is Jean-Claude Ellena one of the best perfumers in the world: Every time when I want to feel strong, independent, or like a true gentleman, I choose one of Ellena's fragrances.\"\n\"It is one of the rare true gifts in the perfume hobby when you find out that you don't always need complex, strong, or bold fragrances to make a statement, and each Ellena's fragrance achieves just that.\"\n\"At first, I didn't understand what was the big deal with Hermes scents while Ellena was an in-house perfumer. Slowly but surely I found magic within the layers of his transparent scents.\"\n\"\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Cartier Declaration For Men\"\n\"\"\n\"3.

Before joining Les Parfums Chanel, Jacques went to work for Roure(Givaudan).\"\n\"His love for perfumery was greatly influenced by his trips as a young child where he spend summers with his family in Grasse and was influenced by vast fields of orange blossom, jasmine, rose, and violets.\"\n\"His perfumes are inspired by the character and work of Mademoiselle Chanel, which are similar to her: contemporary new, and ageless.\"\n\"Why is Jacques Jacques Polge one of the best perfumers in the world: What could be said about Jacque Polge that wasn't said already hundreds of times?\"\n\"Unquestionably, one of the most inspiring and talented perfumers of all time who made perfume trends instead of following them.\"\n\"A man who single-handedly created a whole \"\"blue\"\" perfume genre with Chanel Bleu de Chanel which is still going strong.\"\n\"A superstar perfumer from a time when loyalty to working for just one company was a normal and respectable thing, and a down-to-earth artist which cannot be replaced.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Chanel Allure Homme Sport\"\n\"2. Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme\"\n\"3. Chanel Coco Noir Eau De Parfum\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Chanel Bleu de Chanel Eau de Toilette\"\n\"2. Jacques Guerlain and Jean-Paul Guerlain\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumers: Jacques Guerlain was a French perfumer and the most famous of the Guerlain family, but due to his private life and never granting an interview, little is known about his creative work.\"\n\"Throughout his prolific work over around four hundred fragrances with just over eighty being released he gained universal renown with best-known releases being Mitsouko, Shalimar, and L'Heure Bleue.\"\n\"Jean-Paul Guerlain is a master perfumer and the grandson of Jacques Guerlain who is responsible for most of Guerlain's modern classic perfumes such as Vetiver, Samsara, and Habit Rouge.\"\n\"Unlike his grandfather, Jean-Paul's life was rockier with a couple of well-known scandals that ultimately got his contract terminated at Guerlain as an advisor in 2010.\"\n\"Since there is no heir from the Guerlain family anymore to take over, the role of the in-house perfumer is no longer tied to family succession.\"\n\"Why are Jacques Guerlain and Jean-Paul Guerlain one of the best perfumers in the world: Alright, so putting these two legends together is technically cheating, and is no longer just ten names tied to the list, but there cannot be just one from the legendary house of Guerlain.\"\n\"Both of these guys have shaped and obligated the 20th-century perfume industry that they had to be mentioned both. The term \"\"Guerlainade\"\", was created and used first by Jacques Guerlain which is a code-name for an olfactory harmonious blend of notes and accords essence (powdery, citric, tonka beans, vanilla, floral) used by many fragrance companies.\"\n\"Along with Chanel, Guerlain is responsible for everything we have today in the fragrance world, and how we enjoy our hobby even more.\"\n\"But, on the number one spot, there can be only one, and I guess you already know whose name is gonna be.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Guerlain L'Heure Bleue\"\n\"2. Guerlain Vetiver\"\n\"3. Guerlain Habit Rouge\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Guerlain Shalimar Eau de Parfum\"\n\"1. Dominique Ropion\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Dominique Ropion is a French master perfumer who trained at Roure Bertrand Dupont (Givaudan) in Grasse.\"\n\"A fearless perfectionist and a true inventor with unapologetic risk-taking in perfume creation, Dominique's end results are always flawless and a balance of taste and as he likes to say - \"\"A good perfume, must always appear obvious\"\".\"\n\"His awards include Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2012, the Cosmetic Valley's International Fragrance Prize in 2008, Cosmetique Magazine Oscar in 2010, and in 2018, he received the title of Master Perfumer at IFF.\"\n\"Dominique Ropion is considered to be one of the best and the most technically progressive perfume noses of all time and his perfume catalog includes more than 300 perfumes.\"\n\"Why is Dominique Ropion one of the best perfumers in the world: What exactly makes Ropion hold the number one spot? Is it his perfect balance of notes and accords, or is it maybe his attention to detail like no other perfumer has?\"\n\"Maybe, but the real reason why I have placed his as the best nose of all time is that besides the perfume industry and fragrance enthusiasts, many might not know him by his name, but be sure that millions wear his perfume creations.\"\n\"\"\n\"The man knows his work without getting into mass-pleasing territory like Alberto Morillas does which by the way is not bad as well.\"\n\"Even if anyone disagrees with places some took, I highly doubt anyone could disagree that Dominique is the best nose of all time.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible. Some Master Perfumers recommend going to work",

          "text": "\"Best Perfumers Of All Time: The List\"\n\"While many of these names could be higher or lower on the list depending on your personal fragrance taste, after doing thorough research based on my personal experience with this hobby, and objectively rating everyone, the top three names are undisputably the best out of the rest which shaped and formed everything that classic and modern perfumery is.\"\n\"In case you want to know what perfumers do, here's a little more information for those who wish to know more.\"\n\"WHAT IS A PERFUMER?\"\n\"The perfumer is a skilled trained professional in creating fragrance compositions due to their skills, practices, smell, and artistry in producing olfactory compositions. Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Hugo Boss Boss Bottled\"\n\"2. Boucheron Jaipur Homme\"\n\"3. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Dior Hypnotic Poison\"\n\"9. Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are. Even if he never made another perfume ever again, Pierre has left an indelible mark on the perfume industry and perfume lovers all around the world.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Creed Green Irish Tweed\"\n\"\"\n\"3. Yves Saint Laurent Kouros\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Davidoff Cool Water For Men\"\n\"8. Michel Almairac\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Perfumer Michel Almairac was born in Grasse, France in 1953. He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you. One of the best. Thank you, Michel.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Joop! Homme Joop!\"\n\"\"\n\"3. Gucci pour Homme 1\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Christian Dior Fahrenheit\"\n\"7. Alberto Morillas\"\n\"\"\n\"At the age of ten, he moved to Switzerland where he, later on, studied for two years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva and is the most successful self-taught perfumer in the world.\"\n\"A perfumer with more than 7000 creations whose inspiration is drawn from a combination of innovative natural techniques with breakthrough synthetic molecules and life itself. Alberto is the creator of numerous best-selling men's and women's perfumes that shaped the fragrance industry into what it is today.\"\n\"In 1997, along with his wife, Morillas founded a niche perfume brand Mizensir that offers a line of scented candles and perfumes.\"\n\"Why is Alberto Morillas one of the best perfumers in the world: Depending on the way you look at it, Alberto could be your favorite or worst perfumer in the world.\"\n\"Since I'm always on the objective side of the specter of perfumery, I cannot ignore how much did master perfumer brought to our dear hobby, and how he transcendent from someone being a self-taught chemist to the most popular and adorable perfumer amongst common",

Duchaufour's style of light/dark note combination, especially in his fragrances based on incense has received substantial critical praise. In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now. Nonetheless, Timbuktu from L'Artisan Parfumeur is seriously one of the best fragrances I have smelled in my life, and he has made plenty more on the same level.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Before joining Les Parfums Chanel, Jacques went to work for Roure(Givaudan).\"\n\"His love for perfumery was greatly influenced by his trips as a young child where he spend summers with his family in Grasse and was influenced by vast fields of orange blossom, jasmine, rose, and violets.\"\n\"His perfumes are inspired by the character and work of Mademoiselle Chanel, which are similar to her: contemporary new, and ageless.\"\n\"Why is Jacques Jacques Polge one of the best perfumers in the world: What could be said about Jacque Polge that wasn't said already hundreds of times?\"\n\"Unquestionably, one of the most inspiring and talented perfumers of all time who made perfume trends instead of following them.\"\n\"A man who single-handedly created a whole \"\"blue\"\" perfume genre with Chanel Bleu de Chanel which is still going strong.\"\n\"A superstar perfumer from a time when loyalty to working for just one company was a normal and respectable thing, and a down-to-earth artist which cannot be replaced.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

The term \"\"Guerlainade\"\", was created and used first by Jacques Guerlain which is a code-name for an olfactory harmonious blend of notes and accords essence (powdery, citric, tonka beans, vanilla, floral) used by many fragrance companies.\"\n\"Along with Chanel, Guerlain is responsible for everything we have today in the fragrance world, and how we enjoy our hobby even more.\"\n\"But, on the number one spot, there can be only one, and I guess you already know whose name is gonna be.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Is it his perfect balance of notes and accords, or is it maybe his attention to detail like no other perfumer has?\"\n\"Maybe, but the real reason why I have placed his as the best nose of all time is that besides the perfume industry and fragrance enthusiasts, many might not know him by his name, but be sure that millions wear his perfume creations.\"\n\"\"\n\"The man knows his work without getting into mass-pleasing territory like Alberto Morillas does which by the way is not bad as well.\"\n\"Even if anyone disagrees with places some took, I highly doubt anyone could disagree that Dominique is the best nose of all",

          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible.

Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are.

He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you.

In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now.

Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible. Some Master Perfumers recommend going to work in raw material factories in Grasse. This allows you to be in direct contact with the ingredients, understand their",

Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are.

He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you.

In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now. Nonetheless, Timbuktu from L'Artisan Parfumeur is seriously one of the best fragrances I have smelled in my life, and he has made plenty more on the same level.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Jean-Claude Ellena\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Jean-Claude Ellena is a french perfumer and writer who was born into a family of perfumers in Grasse, France, and from early age picked jasmine with his grandmother to sell to perfumers.\"\n\"A long-time friend of legendary Edmond Roudnitska he began his student and later on, a professional career at an early age in the newly formed Givaudan in 1968.\"\n\"There, Ellena developed his minimalistic approach to perfumery kept until this day of softness, nothing shocking, and a gentlemanly approach.\"\n\"\"\n\"Why is Jean-Claude Ellena one of the best perfumers in the world: Every time when I want to feel strong, independent, or like a true gentleman, I choose one of Ellena's fragrances.\"\n\"It is one of the rare true gifts in the perfume hobby when you find out that you don't always need complex, strong, or bold fragrances to make a statement, and each Ellena's fragrance achieves just that.\"\n\"At first, I didn't understand what was the big deal with Hermes scents while Ellena was an in-house perfumer. Slowly but surely I found magic within the layers of his transparent scents.\"\n\"\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Cartier Declaration For Men\"\n\"\"\n\"3.

The term \"\"Guerlainade\"\", was created and used first by Jacques Guerlain which is a code-name for an olfactory harmonious blend of notes and accords essence (powdery, citric, tonka beans, vanilla, floral) used by many fragrance companies.\"\n\"Along with Chanel, Guerlain is responsible for everything we have today in the fragrance world, and how we enjoy our hobby even more.\"\n\"But, on the number one spot, there can be only one, and I guess you already know whose name is gonna be.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Is it his perfect balance of notes and accords, or is it maybe his attention to detail like no other perfumer has?\"\n\"Maybe, but the real reason why I have placed his as the best nose of all time is that besides the perfume industry and fragrance enthusiasts, many might not know him by his name, but be sure that millions wear his perfume creations.\"\n\"\"\n\"The man knows his work without getting into mass-pleasing territory like Alberto Morillas does which by the way is not bad as well.\"\n\"Even if anyone disagrees with places some took, I highly doubt anyone could disagree that Dominique is the best nose of all time.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

          "text": "\"HOW DO YOU BECOME A PERFUMER?\"\n\"Perfume fascinates and intrigues, but it is the experts behind the perfume that fascinate us most. So who are these mysterious people capable of memorizing and assembling thousands of scents? And how does one become a perfumer? Here are a few tips from Sillages Paris and our four SuperNoses.\"\n\"What's it like being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"The Nose is involved in every step of the perfume-making process, from the initial idea to the final product. They are both the composer and the conductor who accompanies the long and complex process of perfume creation. In order to create their work, they have thousands of raw materials at their disposal to create a perfume, and sometimes carry out more than 100 trials to find the perfect fragrance. Once the (magic!) formula is found, the process of making the perfume can begin.\"\n\"There are two types of Noses: first, those that create for \"\"fine perfumery\"\", that is, luxury. There are only a few hundred of them in the world - even rarer than astronauts! (So 2% of the very best perfumers work for us!). Then there are the perfumers of \"\"functional perfumery\"\" who create perfumes and aromas for mass distribution. They work mainly on household cleaning products and everyday beauty products (deodorants, shampoos, etc.).\"\n\"Noses are mostly employed by major composition houses and raw material manufacturers (Givaudan, Robertet, etc.). But they can also be found working in laboratories belonging to brands, or even freelancing! France continues to dominate the fine perfume market, with the country being home to many of the world's leading brands, major perfume houses, and Master Perfumers. Indeed, perfume made in France is an ancient tradition that still continues today. (Grasse and Paris compete for the title of world capital of perfume!)\"\n\"Is it necessary to have an overdeveloped sense of smell?\"\n\"Just because there are few chosen ones doesn't mean that becoming a perfumer is an unattainable dream! As far as the main work tool is concerned, the sense of smell is a sense that can be worked on and developed over time.\"\n\"Contrary to what one might think, an overdeveloped sense of smell is not a gift from heaven, and unlike musicians with perfect ears, perfect noses don't exist. We're in constant contact with millions of different smells, but we don't usually pay attention to them (except when they're really delicious, or unbearable). So there is only one way to improve your sense of smell: working on it by associating smells with words or images. Like a memory game, this allows us to decipher little by little the nuances of the smells we perceive by putting words to them.\"\n\"Do you know that we are all born with the same olfactory abilities? Our olfactory memory is built between the ages of 0 and 18. So it is our childhood as well as our experiences as children that define our tastes and future choices regarding our sense of smell. Our likes and dislikes are 100% cultural and personal! That's why you can love the smell of gasoline, and others will be disgusted by it. The same goes for smells that may seem \"\"universally\"\" good to you, like jasmine, for example.\"\n\"However, not everyone can create a perfume.\"\n\"A little feedback from our SuperNose perfumers\"\n\"Our four perfumers are friends (with each other, and with Maxime, the founder of Sillages Paris) and are passionate about their profession. We asked them for a little feedback about the road they've traveled to get to this point.\"\n\"\"\n\"What's your advice for becoming a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What pushed you to become a perfumer?\"\n\"Alex Lee: Once upon a time, there was a young schoolboy who, as early as\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"What do you like most about being a perfumer?\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Okay, but how exactly does one become a Perfumer?\"\n\"Prerequisite 1: Have an excellent sense of smell and know how to recognize many smells. Like an oenologist decoding a wine, you have to know how to decipher the different notes of a perfume.\"\n\"Prerequisite 2: A perfumer is an artist. So you have to have a creative spirit and know-how to play with smells to compose olfactory paintings. It's all about imagining images, stories, memories, and creating smells that can evoke them. Like any artist, you have to know how to stand out from the rest with your unique point of view. Furthermore, a perfumer must be able to reinvent himself and not confine himself to a particular style or vocabulary. Trends evolve, as the history of perfume has shown, and you have to know how to keep up with these changes by creating fragrances that resonate with the times. This ability is, in fact, the most important prerequisite.\"\n\"Prerequisite 3: The industrialization of perfume in the 20th century has democratized perfume and transformed the perfumer's profession. Most perfumers nowadays have a solid scientific background, especially in chemistry and biology. This allows them to create new molecules that are impossible to extract naturally (such as the \"\"silent\"\" flowers like lilac or lily of the valley, or many fruits). They also know how to create formulas that don't contain toxic mixes.\"\n\"Training courses\"\n\"You must first start with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biochemistry, or biology, which are the minimum qualifications required before you can get into a Master's degree or one of the more recognized perfume schools.\"\n\"\"\n\"But there are also other ways to become a perfumer:\"\n\"- On-the-job training! Some raw material manufacturers such as Givaudan offer apprenticeships to train young Nezes in-house to create great perfumes one day.\"\n\"- Self-taught training is also possible. Some Master Perfumers recommend going to work in raw material factories in Grasse. This allows you to be in direct contact with the ingredients, understand their",

Each professional perfumer goes through apprenticeships in fragrance schools that last around three years.\"\n\"With acquired in-depth training and experience, a perfumer is able to convey and identify unique and classic fragrance ingredients to compose artistic abstract concepts.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"Her background lies in biochemistry and medicine along with perfumery where she graduated from the French perfume academy ISIPCA.\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"For me, she will always be remembered as the creator of the original Hugo Boss Bottled Eau de Toilette which made me get more seriously into the perfume hobby.\"\n\"With her contemporary, and posh style that is fueled by her passion for perfumery and arts, Annick has her name behind more than 100 fragrance creations today which is an achievement of its own.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Hugo Boss Boss Bottled\"\n\"2. Boucheron Jaipur Homme\"\n\"3. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Gio\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Dior Hypnotic Poison\"\n\"9. Pierre Bourdon\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Pierre Bourdon is a perfumer who was Edmond Roudnitska's only student and inherited his precise perfume technique.\"\n\"One of his most important achievements during his long-lasting carer was the implementation of Roudnitska's mindset of perfumes being created as works of art.\"\n\"Before deciding to make a career in perfumery, Pierre earned a degree in political science, and in 1971 studied under Jean Carles in Roure Bertrand Dupont. He is the owner of the Pierre Bourdon brand and previously worked with Takasago, Quest, and Fragrance Resources.\"\n\"Why is Pierre Bourdon one of the best perfumers in the world: The creator of the first official aquatic fragrance for men, the nose behind the most popular Creed fragrances, and a man who wasn't a stranger working for different companies for higher-end and commercial fragrance brands, Pierre has done it all.\"\n\"\"\n\"Most of his popular creations have been in my perfume collection, and some still are. Even if he never made another perfume ever again, Pierre has left an indelible mark on the perfume industry and perfume lovers all around the world.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Michel Almairac\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Perfumer Michel Almairac was born in Grasse, France in 1953. He attended perfumery school at Roure Bertrand Dupont which is now part of Givaudan.\"\n\"At various times, he has also worked with Takasago, Creations Aromatiques, and Drom, and a currently employed by Parle Moi de Parfum.\"\n\"He considers his work a passion and always goes by the following statement: \"\"I always use simple, short formulas. If you get it wrong and have to start from scratch, it's easier to correct.\"\"\"\n\"A man who always searches a new inspiration, and is known to often find it the art of blending in a combination of modern and classical ingredients which he compares to cooking.\"\n\"Why is Michel Almairac one of the best perfumers in the world: It is hard to dislike someone like Michel. Although his importance and recognition are like something carved in a rock, I do feel that he deserves more than he gets.\"\n\"Another perfumer that came from the long-gone perfume world where you didn't have to tell customers that your perfume is \"\"art\"\" just to sell it for more without actually being the real deal, Michel created many artistic and loved creations like it was a no big deal.\"\n\"Here is my salute to you. One of the best. Thank you, Michel.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Joop! Homme Joop!\"\n\"\"\n\"3. Gucci pour Homme 1\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Christian Dior Fahrenheit\"\n\"7. Alberto Morillas\"\n\"\"\n\"At the age of ten, he moved to Switzerland where he, later on, studied for two years at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Geneva and is the most successful self-taught perfumer in the world.\"\n\"A perfumer with more than 7000 creations whose inspiration is drawn from a combination of innovative natural techniques with breakthrough synthetic molecules and life itself. Alberto is the creator of numerous best-selling men's and women's perfumes that shaped the fragrance industry into what it is today.\"\n\"In 1997, along with his wife, Morillas founded a niche perfume brand Mizensir that offers a line of scented candles and perfumes.\"\n\"Why is Alberto Morillas one of the best perfumers in the world: Depending on the way you look at it, Alberto could be your favorite or worst perfumer in the world.\"\n\"Since I'm always on the objective side of the specter of perfumery, I cannot ignore how much did master perfumer brought to our dear hobby, and how he transcendent from someone being a self-taught chemist to the most popular and adorable perfumer amongst common folk and perfume enthusiasts.\"\n\"I highly doubt that the perfume industry would be",

Duchaufour's style of light/dark note combination, especially in his fragrances based on incense has received substantial critical praise. In 2017, Duchaufour was awarded perfumer of the year by the Russian FiFi Awards.\"\n\"Why is Bertrand Duchaufour one of the best perfumers in the world: Duchaufour is the kind of perfumer you either praise to the heavens and back or you can't stand his mostly darker creations.\"\n\"If you ask me, Bertrand has captured both the lighter and darker compositions into one creation, always adding a twist to avoid smelling like anything else.\"\n\"Although some might be shocked to find him so low on this list, I cannot justify placing him above superstar perfumers which is coming up just right now. Nonetheless, Timbuktu from L'Artisan Parfumeur is seriously one of the best fragrances I have smelled in my life, and he has made plenty more on the same level.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Not to mention that a variety of celebrities also wear and promote MFK perfumes.\"\n\"In my opinion, MFK house offers a variety of innovative fragrances everyone should get their nose at, but I also recommend checking out some of his fragrances done for other companies where his creativity is pointed to the more creative way.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male\"\n\"2. Elizabeth Arden Green Tea\"\n\"3. Narciso Rodriguez for Him\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 Eau De Parfum\"\n\"4. Jean-Claude Ellena\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Jean-Claude Ellena is a french perfumer and writer who was born into a family of perfumers in Grasse, France, and from early age picked jasmine with his grandmother to sell to perfumers.\"\n\"A long-time friend of legendary Edmond Roudnitska he began his student and later on, a professional career at an early age in the newly formed Givaudan in 1968.\"\n\"There, Ellena developed his minimalistic approach to perfumery kept until this day of softness, nothing shocking, and a gentlemanly approach.\"\n\"\"\n\"Why is Jean-Claude Ellena one of the best perfumers in the world: Every time when I want to feel strong, independent, or like a true gentleman, I choose one of Ellena's fragrances.\"\n\"It is one of the rare true gifts in the perfume hobby when you find out that you don't always need complex, strong, or bold fragrances to make a statement, and each Ellena's fragrance achieves just that.\"\n\"At first, I didn't understand what was the big deal with Hermes scents while Ellena was an in-house perfumer. Slowly but surely I found magic within the layers of his transparent scents.\"\n\"\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Cartier Declaration For Men\"\n\"\"\n\"3.

The term \"\"Guerlainade\"\", was created and used first by Jacques Guerlain which is a code-name for an olfactory harmonious blend of notes and accords essence (powdery, citric, tonka beans, vanilla, floral) used by many fragrance companies.\"\n\"Along with Chanel, Guerlain is responsible for everything we have today in the fragrance world, and how we enjoy our hobby even more.\"\n\"But, on the number one spot, there can be only one, and I guess you already know whose name is gonna be.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1.

Dominique Ropion\"\n\"A short biography about the perfumer: Dominique Ropion is a French master perfumer who trained at Roure Bertrand Dupont (Givaudan) in Grasse.\"\n\"A fearless perfectionist and a true inventor with unapologetic risk-taking in perfume creation, Dominique's end results are always flawless and a balance of taste and as he likes to say - \"\"A good perfume, must always appear obvious\"\".\"\n\"His awards include Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2012, the Cosmetic Valley's International Fragrance Prize in 2008, Cosmetique Magazine Oscar in 2010, and in 2018, he received the title of Master Perfumer at IFF.\"\n\"Dominique Ropion is considered to be one of the best and the most technically progressive perfume noses of all time and his perfume catalog includes more than 300 perfumes.\"\n\"Why is Dominique Ropion one of the best perfumers in the world: What exactly makes Ropion hold the number one spot? Is it his perfect balance of notes and accords, or is it maybe his attention to detail like no other perfumer has?\"\n\"Maybe, but the real reason why I have placed his as the best nose of all time is that besides the perfume industry and fragrance enthusiasts, many might not know him by his name, but be sure that millions wear his perfume creations.\"\n\"\"\n\"The man knows his work without getting into mass-pleasing territory like Alberto Morillas does which by the way is not bad as well.\"\n\"Even if anyone disagrees with places some took, I highly doubt anyone could disagree that Dominique is the best nose of all time.\"\n\"Notable work:\"\n\"1. Thierry Mugler Alien\"\n\"2. Frederic Malle Portrait of a Lady\"\n\"\"\n\"MOST POPULAR CREATION - Yves Saint Laurent La Nuit de l'Homme\"\n\"Conclusion\"\n\"\"\n\"And there you have it. I'm proud",
